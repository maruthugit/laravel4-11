              <li>If the provisions in this Condition 7 are not effective according to the law of the country in which the Goods are located, the legal concept closest in nature to retention of title in that country shall be deemed to apply mutatis mutandis to give effect to the underlying intent expressed in this condition, and the Buyer shall take all steps necessary to give effect to the same.</li>

                      <li>Any description given of the Goods is given by way of identification only and the use of such description shall not constitute a sale by description.</li>
                      <li>tmGrocer binds itself only to deliver Goods in accordance with the general description under which they were sold, whether or not any special or particular description shall have been given or shall be implied by law. Any such special or particular description shall be taken only as the expression of tmGrocer's opinion in that behalf. tmGrocer does not give any warranty as to the quality state condition or fitness of the Goods.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Any claim by the Buyer which is based on any defect in the quality or condition of the Goods or their failure to correspond with specification shall be notified to tmGrocer within seven days from the date of receipt of the Goods or (where the defect or failure was not apparent on reasonable inspection) within a reasonable time after discovery of the defect or failure.
